        This method handles copying work file path(s) to a designated publish
        location.

        This method requires a "work_template" and a "publish_template" be set
        on the supplied item.

        The method will handle copying the "path" property to the corresponding
        publish location assuming the path corresponds to the "work_template"
        and the fields extracted from the "work_template" are sufficient to
        satisfy the "publish_template".

        The method will not attempt to copy files if any of the above
        requirements are not met. If the requirements are met, the file will
        ensure the publish path folder exists and then copy the file to that
        location.

        If the item has "sequence_paths" set, it will attempt to copy all paths
        assuming they meet the required criteria with respect to the templates.
